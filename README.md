This Python code is a password generator that asks users how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password. It uses the `random` module to select characters randomly from predefined lists of letters, numbers, and symbols. 

The program first collects user input for the desired number of each type of character. It then generates the password by randomly selecting the specified number of each type and adding them to a list. This list is shuffled to ensure a random order, and the characters are joined together to form the final password. The resulting password is then printed for the user. 

The code includes both an easy and a hard level, but the easy level is commented out. The hard level shuffles the character list for improved security.
